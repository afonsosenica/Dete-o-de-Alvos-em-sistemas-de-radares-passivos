abstract = {This resource introduces the basic principles of passive radar technology and provides an overview of recent developments in this field and existing real passive radar systems. this book explains how passive radar works, how it differs from the active type, and demonstrates the benefits and drawbacks of this novel technology. Properties of illuminators, including ambiguity functions, digital vs. analog, digitally coded waveforms, vertical-plane coverage, and satellite-borne and radar illuminators are explored. Introduction -- Principles of passive radar -- Properties of illuminators -- Direct signal suppression -- Passive radar performance prediction -- Detection and tracking -- Examples of systems and results -- Future developments and applications.},

abstract = {This book introduces the fundamental principles of antenna theory and explains how to apply them to the analysis, design, and measurements of antennas. Due to the variety of methods of analysis and design, and the different antenna structures available, the applications covered in this book are made to some of the most basic and practical antenna configurations. Among these antenna configurations are linear dipoles; loops; arrays; broadband antennas; aperture antennas; horns; microstrip antennas; and reflector antennas. The text contains sufficient mathematical detail to enable undergraduate and beginning graduate students in electrical engineering and physics to follow the flow of analysis and design. Readers should have a basic knowledge of undergraduate electromagnetic theory, including Maxwell's equations and the wave equation, introductory physics, and differential and integral calculus. -- Antennas -- Fundamental parameters and figures-of-merit of antennas -- Radiation integrals and auxillary potential functions -- Linear wire antennas -- Loop antennas -- Arrays: linear, planar, and circular -- Antenna synthesis and continuous sources -- Integral equations, moment method, and self and mutual impedances -- Broadband dipoles and matching techniques -- Traveling wave and broadband antennas -- Frequency independent antennas, antenna miniaturization, and fractal antennas -- Apeture antennas -- Horn antennas -- Microstrip and mobile communications antennas -- Reflector antennas -- Smart antennas -- Antenna measurements.},
