@book{Willis2005,
abstract = {Annotation his book is a major extension of a chapter on bistatic radar written by the author for the Radar Handbook, 2nd edition, edited by Merrill Skolnik. It provides a history of bistatic systems that points out to potential designers the applications that have worked and the dead-ends not worth pursuing. The text reviews the basic concepts and definitions, and explains the mathematical development of relationships, such as geometry, Ovals of Cassini, dynamic range, isorange and isodoppler contours, target doppler, and clutter doppler spread.Key Features * All development and analysis are derived from first order principles or referenced to established literature. * All approximations are accompanied by error analyses. All bistatic radar equations are rationalized; i.e., they are shown in the limit to reduce to monostatic radar equations. * Past bistatic radar developments and programs are critiqued. Fundamental advantages and limitations are identified. Potential bistatic radar applications are developed and assessed. * The 329 pages include plentiful figures, tables, equations, six appendices and a bibliography.},

@book{Balanis2016,
abstract = {This book introduces the fundamental principles of antenna theory and explains how to apply them to the analysis, design, and measurements of antennas. Due to the variety of methods of analysis and design, and the different antenna structures available, the applications covered in this book are made to some of the most basic and practical antenna configurations. Among these antenna configurations are linear dipoles; loops; arrays; broadband antennas; aperture antennas; horns; microstrip antennas; and reflector antennas. The text contains sufficient mathematical detail to enable undergraduate and beginning graduate students in electrical engineering and physics to follow the flow of analysis and design. Readers should have a basic knowledge of undergraduate electromagnetic theory, including Maxwell's equations and the wave equation, introductory physics, and differential and integral calculus. -- Antennas -- Fundamental parameters and figures-of-merit of antennas -- Radiation integrals and auxillary potential functions -- Linear wire antennas -- Loop antennas -- Arrays: linear, planar, and circular -- Antenna synthesis and continuous sources -- Integral equations, moment method, and self and mutual impedances -- Broadband dipoles and matching techniques -- Traveling wave and broadband antennas -- Frequency independent antennas, antenna miniaturization, and fractal antennas -- Apeture antennas -- Horn antennas -- Microstrip and mobile communications antennas -- Reflector antennas -- Smart antennas -- Antenna measurements.},

@article{Martorella,
abstract = {Passive Coherent Location (PCL, or alternatively Passive Radar - PR) offers the ability to detect targets by using illuminators of opportunity. The principles of PCL are quite easy to understand as we can treat it as an active radar once the IO direct signal is acquired. Nevertheless, there are a number of issues that are specific to PCL that are not present in the case of active radar and that must be studied and dealt with when it comes to detecting targets. In these notes, fundamentals of detection for PCL are provided along with a number of signal processing techniques that have been developed to solve specific issues related to passive radar scenarios. This paper is to be considered as companion notes for the NATO Lecture on “PCL detection fundamentals” of the Lecture Series SET-243 on Passive Radar.},

Although, passive radar does not aim to replace active radar, it provides a good complement to it. The computational effort that is required to implement the required signal processing is one of the drawbacks that affect passive radar. In this paper a computationally affordable algorithm is proposed and its performance tested by using a numerical simulation.},
